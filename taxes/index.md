# Taxes!

We are required to collect and remit sales tax in a number of US states and localities. Not all states tax the sale of software as a service (SaaS), but it’s becoming increasingly common. If your state or city is on the list below, you’ll see a line item on your monthly invoice for sales tax. The rate being collected on your invoice is determined by your billing address. As regulations change, we will update this list.

## Jurisdictions we collect and remit taxes for
You’ll see sales tax on your invoice if you live in:

* Arizona
* Chicago (Illinois)
* Connecticut
* District of Columbia
* Hawaii
* Massachusetts
* New Mexico
* Ohio
* Pennsylvania
* Rhode Island
* South Carolina
* South Dakota
* Tennessee
* Texas
* Utah
* Washington
* West Virginia

## Updating your billing address
If you need to change your billing information because you don’t actually reside in a taxable jurisdiction, you can easily handle that within your accounts. You may need to re-enter your credit card information as part of the billing address update. Follow these links to see how to your update your credit card in:
